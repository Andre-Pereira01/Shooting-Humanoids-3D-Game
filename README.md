# Shooting-Humanoids-3D-Game
A simple game made for the Computer Graphics discipline, using the “three.js” WebGL Library.
In summary, the scenario includes the following elements:
- Construction of complex 3D objects using the basic primitives of three.js. The 3D objects created are textured using both native materials and imported textures (the environment is also complemented with imported 3D objects).
- Camera configuration: it is possible to switch between a perspective camera and orthographic camera configuration.
- Lights configuration: there are several types of lights (PointLight, DirectionalLight and/or AmbientLight), and it is possible to turn off each type of light individually.
- Interaction with the scene: the user interacts with the scene using the mouse and/or keyboard.
-Animation: objects are animated in order to demonstrate a concept to be illustrated. It is possible to repeat/review the animation.
